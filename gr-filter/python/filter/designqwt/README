This is the filter design tool written using PyQWT. It is deprecated
in favor of QT4/5 and will be removed in the next API version change
of GNU Radio.

The current benefits of this version of the filter design tool is that
it uses PyQWT, which we have been using for a while in GNU Radio and
so may already be available on your system. However, work on PyQWT has
stalled and is significantly lagging, so we are moving to a
better-supported toolkit, PyQtGraph.

The real benefit of this tool is that it supports interactive
Pole/Zero and Band-Edge Diagram plots. The design and callbacks for
this are not yet available in the Qt4/Qt5 versions, though they will
be before this version is removed.
