This version of the filter design tool is a temporary step towards the
QT5 version that will be fully supported once GNU Radio switches to
using QT5 for everything. They work identically except for the
versions of QT and PyQtGraph being supported. The changes are fairly
minimal; mostly in the module names that have changed and in a few
niceties provided in QT5.

Todos:

 * Same todo's as QT5 version
